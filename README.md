# DataStructure-Practice

As a non-CS grad, I have naturally never taken a class on data structures or algorithms. However, I do find this topic very interesting, and I'm therefore working through several different online resources to learn more. This folder will contain any files I create while doing this. 

If you see any errors, let me know!
